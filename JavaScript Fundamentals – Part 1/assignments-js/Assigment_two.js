//Variables from assignment one
let country = 'Indonesia';
 let continent = 'Asia';
 let population = 10;

//Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable 'language', but don't assign it any value yet
let isIsland = true;
 let language; //just declaration variable will output undefined

 //Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language' to the console
 console.log(typeof isIsland); //boolean value because isIsland value is true that is boolean value
 console.log(typeof population); //integer value because population value is integer
 console.log(typeof country);  //string value because country value is string
 console.log(typeof language); //undefined value because language value haven't been assigned yet
